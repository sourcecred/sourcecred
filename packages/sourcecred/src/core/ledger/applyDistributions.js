 * - The last time there was a distribution was two days ago. Since then,

 *
 * - The last time there was a distribution was last week. Since then, one new
 *   Cred Interval has been completed. The method will apply one Distribution.

 * - The last time there was a distribution was a month ago. Since then, four

 * It returns the list of applied distributions, which may be helpful for
