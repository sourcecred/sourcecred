Technically, a once-nested key-value store that maps key-subkey pairs to weights and
specifies a default weight at the key-level that can be used when a queried subkey
is not found.

A Discord-based example might look like:

  "key": "channel",
  "default": 1,
  "subkeys": [
    { "subkey": "12345678", memo: "props", weight: 3 }
